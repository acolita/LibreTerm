# LibreTerm v0.5.2 Plan (CI/CD)

**Goal:** implement GitHub Actions to automatically build the application on commit and create releases when a version tag is pushed.

## 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
*   **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch.
*   **OS:** `windows-latest`.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Checkout:** Fetch the repository.
    2.  **Setup MSVC:** Use `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd` to set up the Visual Studio environment variables (cl.exe, link.exe, rc.exe).
    3.  **Build:** Execute `build.bat`.
    4.  **Upload Artifact:** Upload `build/LibreTerm.exe` as a build artifact for testing.

## 2. Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
*   **Trigger:** Push of a tag matching `v*` (e.g., `v0.5.2`).
*   **OS:** `windows-latest`.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Checkout:** Fetch the repository.
    2.  **Setup MSVC:** Set up compiler environment.
    3.  **Build:** Execute `build.bat`.
    4.  **Create Release:** Use `softprops/action-gh-release` to:
        *   Create a GitHub Release based on the tag.
        *   Upload `LibreTerm.exe` as a release asset.
        *   (Optional) Zip the executable if needed.

## 3. Build Script Updates
*   Ensure `build.bat` works cleanly in a non-interactive environment (the current script is mostly fine, but we might want to ensure `taskkill` doesn't fail the build if nothing is running).

## 4. Implementation Steps
1.  Create `.github/workflows` directory.
2.  Create `ci.yml` (combining build and release logic usually is easier).
3.  Push to GitHub to verify the action runs.
