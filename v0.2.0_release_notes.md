# wstc v0.2.0 Release Notes

**Changes:**
- **Persistence:** Connections are now saved to `%APPDATA%\wstc\connections.ini`.
- **New Connection Dialog:** Native Win32 dialog to add connections (Name, Host, Port, User, Args).
- **Data Model:** Replaced hardcoded dummy data with a dynamic `ConnectionManager`.
- **First Run Experience:** Automatically creates an "Example Host" if no connections exist.
- **Menu Bar:** Added "File -> New Connection" and "File -> Exit".

**How to test:**
1. Run `run.bat`.
2. See "Example Host" in the sidebar.
3. Go to `File -> New Connection`.
4. Enter details (e.g., Name: "My Server", Host: "10.0.0.1").
5. Click OK.
6. The new connection appears in the sidebar immediately.
7. Double-click to launch (it will use Fake PuTTY for now).
8. Restart the app to verify persistence.
